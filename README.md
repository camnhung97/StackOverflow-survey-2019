# Stack-Overflow-survey-2019
Background
I was looking to better understand the demographic of worldwide professional developers participating in the annual survey conducted by Stack Overflow and the relationship between Age and Annual Compensation. 
The survey data was later open sourced by Stack Overflow from the following source: https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/04/09/the-2019-stack-overflow-developer-survey-results-are-in/
